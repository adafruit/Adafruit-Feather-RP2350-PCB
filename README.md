(more soooon!)


Please note: The Adafruit Feather RP2350 HSTX comes with the A2 version of the RP2350, which is affected by the E9 erratum. This errata affects some uses of GPIO and PIO such as high-impedance inputs and the internal pulldowns. You may need to use 8.2K or smaller resistors if pull-downs are required. At this time, Sept 9 2024, there is no other version of the RP2350 available - only the A2 version.
